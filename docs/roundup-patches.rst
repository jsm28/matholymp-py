Roundup patches
===============

Matholymp comes with some patches to `Roundup
<http://roundup-tracker.org/>`_ that have been found useful when using
the matholymp's online registration functionality based on Roundup.
It may be useful to apply these patches to the Roundup sources before
installing Roundup.  All these patches can be applied with
:command:`patch -p1 -N -E` from within the Roundup source directory.

These are located in the :file:`roundup-patches/` directory of the
source distribution, and are relative to Roundup version 2.3.0 (so may
require changes to apply cleanly to later versions).  Details of the
individual patches are:

* :download:`issue2550750-no-timeout-mail.patch
  <../roundup-patches/issue2550750-no-timeout-mail.patch>` is a patch
  for `Roundup issue 2550750
  <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550750>`_ that avoids
  socket timeouts (when large images are served through Roundup, for
  example) generating emails to the person running the registration
  system.

* :download:`increase-socket-timeout.patch
  <../roundup-patches/increase-socket-timeout.patch>` is a patch that
  increases the socket timeout to reduce the number of such timeouts
  (there may however not be a great need for this when the previous
  patch is applied).
