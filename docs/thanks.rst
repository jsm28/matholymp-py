I'd like to thank many people for their feedback that has gone into
the matholymp software (whether during the early stages of development
when it was just software for EGMO 2012, or EGMO in general, or later
when it was generic software for olympiads), and for their work for
olympiads using this software that has helped point to features that
would be useful for the software.  I haven't kept good records of
everyone who has helped in such ways; they include, but are not
limited to:
