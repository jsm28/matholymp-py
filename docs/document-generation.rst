Document generation
===================

Matholymp provides a script :command:`mo-document-generate` to
generate a range of documents, such as name badges and exam papers in
the right languages with each contestant's contestant code printed on
them, from registration system data.

:command:`mo-document-generate` expects to be run from a directory
containing:

* A file :file:`documentgen.cfg` configuring the document generation
  (parts of this file can stay the same from year to year, but parts
  will need updating for each year's event).

* A subdirectory :file:`templates/` with various LaTeX templates for
  documents and PDF backgrounds and logos.  These are built with
  :command:`pdflatex`, unless they contain the string ``xelatex`` in
  which case they are built with :command:`xelatex` instead.

* A subdirectory :file:`papers/{year}/` containing LaTeX sources or
  PDFs of exam papers (from leaders, before headings and backgrounds
  are added by the script).

* A subdirectory :file:`data/` containing data from the registration
  system: :file:`countries.csv`, :file:`people.csv` (the full CSV file
  of people, downloaded while logged in administratively) and
  subdirectories :file:`flags/` and :file:`photos/` unpacked from the
  ZIP files downloaded from the registration system.

* A subdirectory :file:`out/` (which may initially be empty), where
  output files are placed by the script.

Example files
-------------

The :file:`examples/document-generation/` directory in the matholymp
source distribution includes versions of :download:`documentgen.cfg
<../examples/document-generation/documentgen.cfg>` and LaTeX templates
that may be used as a basis for configuring document generation.  It
also includes an example exam paper :download:`English-day1.tex
<../examples/document-generation/English-day1.tex>` that sets suitable
page margins that are compatible with how the included LaTeX templates
position various headings on the page.

Graphic design
--------------

The LaTeX templates provided are those used for EGMO.  In various
places they conditionally include PDF files with backgrounds or logos
that are not included; you will need to provide such files for your
event if generating affected documents.  It is likely that you will
need to adapt these templates to fix the layout of the backgrounds you
provide, unless those are laid out exactly the same as those used for
EGMO.  (If nothing else, the clipping when the logo is included is
unlikely to be correct for another event.)

Document generation tasks
-------------------------

The following describes how to generate various documents with
:command:`mo-document-generate`.  In all cases, the commands should be
run from the directory with contents detailed above.  Although the
examples generally describe how to generate a full set of documents,
you can also generally generate documents relating to individual
people, by giving that person's number (in the registration system) or
contestant code in place of ``all``.

Name badges
^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate all name badges (for participants who are, or might be,
attending in person)::

   mo-document-generate --background badge all

Omit ``--background`` if each badge is to be printed onto card with
the appropriate background pre-printed, instead of including the
backgrounds in the PDFs generated by :command:`mo-document-generate`.

To generate name badges using photos that have been provided for
producing name badges, where the person concerned does not wish them
to be public on the registration site but the registration system
support for specifying permissions for particular uses of photos has
not been enabled, you need to copy the relevant photos into new
subdirectories of :file:`data/photos/` not corresponding to any photo
from the registration system and edit :file:`people.csv` to enter
values in the Photo URL column that cause those photos to be selected.

Invitation letters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate an invitation letter for a given person::

   mo-document-generate invitation-letter *number*

To generate invitation letters for all participants (who are, or might
be, attending in person):

   mo-document-generate invitation-letter all

Desk labels
^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate labels for contestant desks for the exams (the example
template expects to put these on 127mm by 76mm cards, but of course
you can change the template to print them in some other way)::

   mo-document-generate desk-label all

This prints labels in a default order (all Contestants 1, then all
Contestants 2, and so on).  The :samp:`--exam-order {file}` option may
be used to specify a text file listing contestant codes if a different
order is required.  Labels are only generated for contestants who are,
or might be, attending in person.

Checklist of languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate a checklist :file:`language-list.txt` of which contestants
have requested papers in which languages, and a checklist
:file:`language-status.txt` of which languages have papers available::

   mo-document-generate language-list all

Exam papers
^^^^^^^^^^^

Give the English papers to leaders in LaTeX form with appropriate page
margins.  Collect translations and put them in the
:file:`papers/{year}/` directory, with PDFs having names such as
:file:`English-day1.pdf` (or just :file:`English.pdf` for a single-day
competition); in the filename, all characters that are not ASCII
letters are omitted from the language name (so a paper for "French
(Swiss)" would be :file:`FrenchSwiss-day1.pdf`, for example).  If the
paper is produced using LaTeX, only the file with a name such as
:file:`English-day1.tex` needs to go in that directory;
:command:`mo-document-generate` will run :command:`pdflatex` on such a
file automatically (the generated PDF will go in the :file:`out/`
directory, and be updated automatically if the LaTeX source changes).
If both the PDF and LaTeX source are present, only the PDF will be
used, so watch out for a PDF being out of date with respect to the
LaTeX file.  If a leader wishes to use Word, make sure that the page
margins are correct and again get a matching PDF file.  Given the
appropriately-named LaTeX sources or PDFs of papers from leaders,
there are then several documents that can be generated.

For draft papers to display::

   mo-document-generate paper new-drafts

That will generate draft papers for all translations that are new or
modified since the previous run (if any) of that command.  To generate
drafts instead for a specific language (add :samp:`--day {day}` to
generate these only for a particular day; the language name is as used
in filenames):

.. parsed-literal::

   mo-document-generate paper *language*

For final papers for exams (this will generate a PDF of each day's
papers, that includes papers for each contestant in the right
languages marked with their contestant code, as well as such PDFs of
papers for leaders in all the languages requested by their students;
omit the :samp:`--day {day}` option if there is only one day at the
competition)::

   mo-document-generate --day 1 paper all
   mo-document-generate --day 2 paper all

This prints papers in a default order (all Contestants 1, then all
Contestants 2, and so on).  The :samp:`--exam-order {file}` option may
be used to specify a text file listing contestant codes if a different
order is required.  To generate papers for individual contestants in
separate files, a contestant code may be used in place of :samp:`all`;
use :samp:`all-split` to generate papers for all contestants in
separate files, or :samp:`all-split-remote` to do so only for
contestants who are, or may be, remote participants at a hybrid
event.  To generate a single file for a day's papers, but only for
participants who are, or may be, participating in person at a hybrid
event, use :samp:`all-in-person`.

For final papers for the website (if papers are being printed with
pre-printed backgrounds, use both commands, otherwise just the first
command; these commands generate the files to be imported to the
website with :command:`mo-static-papers-import`)::

   mo-document-generate paper all-languages
   mo-document-generate --background paper all-languages

Handling handwritten papers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a leader handwrites their translation, scan the paper (black and
white with appropriate threshold), crop the scan and make it
transparent.  Then you can create a LaTeX file for the document to
include the scan; the main part should look like::

   \begin{document}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=16cm,height=20cm,keepaspectratio]{Language-dayN-scan.png}
   \end{center}
   \end{document}

The following steps may be helpful for the process of making a scan
transparent in GIMP:

* :menuselection:`Layer --> Transparency --> Add Alpha Channel`.

* :menuselection:`Select --> By Colour`.

* Click on the colour you want to become transparent (i.e., white).
  The selection is highlighted with some dashed lines.

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Clear`.

* Save the file as PNG.

Coordination forms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate coordination forms (the example template will need
adapting if you have more than four contestants per team)::

   mo-document-generate coord-form all

Add ``--background`` if a background design is to be used in the
forms, but they are not printed on paper with that design pre-printed.

Certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If generating certificates for awards, :file:`people.csv` needs to
have been downloaded after the final results and medal boundaries were
entered, and the medal boundaries must also have been entered in
:file:`documentgen.cfg`.  Then do::

   mo-document-generate participation-certificate all
   mo-document-generate award-certificate gold
   mo-document-generate award-certificate silver
   mo-document-generate award-certificate bronze
   mo-document-generate award-certificate hm

Add ``--background`` if the certificates are to be printed complete
with background, instead of just printing names, roles and countries
on pre-printed certificates.

Bulk upload of scores
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the network access at the olympiad site is so poor as to cause
problems for entering scores online during the competition, it may be
necessary to enter scores in a spreadsheet offline and then upload
them to the registration system in bulk.  In that case, create a CSV
file (with BOM) in :file:`data/scores-in.csv`, with columns
"Contestant Code" and "Pn" for each problem.  Then do::

   mo-document-generate scores-commands all

This generates a Unix shell script :file:`upload-scores` to use
:command:`roundup-admin` to upload the scores.  On the system running
the registration system, as the user running that system, then do:

.. parsed-literal::

   sh upload-scores *path-to-roundup-admin* *path-to-instance*
