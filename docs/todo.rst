Matholymp todo list
===================

The following lists ideas for possible changes and improvements to
matholymp, both internal and user-visible.  Many of these ideas are
speculative, I may have further ideas not written here about how a
change should be implemented and I may not always be sure that a
change would be desirable, so it would be a good idea to discuss
possible changes with me first before implementing ideas listed here.
If you are reading the version of this list in the online
documentation for a release, you should also check the current Git
version for any changes to the list.  See also :ref:`contributing`.

Changes are likely to be a higher priority if they are known to be of
use for a specific event that is using or planning to use matholymp.
Some entries in this list reflect known areas of variation between
different events (so would be necessary or useful if events with that
form of variation from what matholymp currently does were to choose to
adopt it).

General and global changes
--------------------------

* Support coordination timetabling (displaying a timetable showing
  active and pending coordinations; also generating a timetable if
  desired).

* Implement better sorting of roles / contestant codes (numerical
  rather than simply alphabetic) if 10 or more contestants.  (Applies
  to registration system sorting as well as to main
  :py:mod:`matholymp.data` sorting.)

* Handle restricted subsets of possible scores on a problem, where the
  rules of a competition do not allow all scores from 0 to the
  maximum.

* Support awards not algorithmically derived from scores and
  annotations relating to awards.

* Support disqualifications (explicitly showing that there was one
  rather than just removing people and countries).

* Support name orders other than given-family.

* Support mononymous people.

* Support multilingual output support rather than just English.

* Avoid Y10K problems (throughout, allow more-than-4-digit years).

* Make all static site and registration system text generated from
  Python code rather than templates more customisable.

* Add graphical statistics of results and individual and country
  performance over time.

* Display (and include in CSV files) also ranks limited to official
  countries and contestants, and support distinguishing them in tables
  by using different CSS styles.

* Support gender as optionally public information (generally or for
  contestants).

* Allow SVG images of flags and generate PNG automatically for LaTeX
  inclusion.

* Allow for a global configuration file rather than separate files for
  each part of the system; also allow scripts to read multiple
  configuration files (shared and non-shared).

* Add web interfaces for more things currently done on command line.

* Don't hardcode ``en_GB`` as locale for collation.

* Include Python API documentation in generated documentation.

* Add automated testing for error cases in scripts.

* Consistently pass ids to :py:func:`file_url_to_local` as integers,
  not sometimes integers (document generation) and sometimes strings
  (:command:`mo-static-import`).

* Make capitalization of exception messages consistent.

* Take advantage of missing CSV entries being output as ``''`` by
  Python by default to simplify code.

* Use more specific exception classes rather than :py:exc:`ValueError`
  etc. everywhere.

* Review code style against the current version of :pep:`8` and fix or
  update style accordingly.

Static site
-----------

* Allow CSV files to specify event short and long names, and the
  number of contestants for ranking, so those can vary from year to
  year.

* Support not showing the host country / city if always the same.

* Support (in matholymp rather than through hardcoding redirects in
  web server configuration) merging people; removing people (if later
  determined not to have been there, etc.); incomplete scores or names
  information for old events.  E.g., add a ``Redirect Person Numbers``
  column in :file:`people.csv` plus allowing ``Annual URL`` to be a
  comma-separated list, together with :command:`mo-static-upgrade`
  support, tests and documentation.

* Add a general index of all problem papers for all years.

* Support a host country that did not previously take part (e.g., when
  a planned host splits up, or for a completely new event), and
  generally ensure the site looks sensible when there are no past
  events.

* Make :command:`mo-static-generate` support running a command to
  postprocess its ouput, or commands to postprocess and push to
  production.

* Make :command:`mo-static-import` ignore excess data (e.g., from
  having the full version of :file:`people.csv` instead of the public
  version) rather than giving errors for it.

* Make :command:`mo-static-import` support downloading all data itself
  (including medal boundaries, via the medal_boundaries_csv action),
  and setting medal boundaries, so just running
  :command:`mo-static-import` with no arguments does everything needed
  after an event to transfer data to the static site.  At present, it
  can download most data, but not medal boundaries, and requires a
  directory to be specified explicitly.

* Make :command:`mo-static-import` and
  :command:`mo-static-papers-import` support automatically running
  :command:`mo-static-generate` (possibly with postprocessing
  commands).

Registration system
-------------------

* Support bulk emails (announcements) to registration contacts.

* Add downloadable (given administrative access) full version of
  country list including contact details.

* Extend automatic checks / warnings for all-uppercase names: also
  warn on the registration status page.

* Possibly make :file:`person.item.html` advise people of the
  recommended maximum file size for photos (in human-friendly form
  rather than a raw number of bytes).  File extension and contents
  should also be checked to agree with MIME type.  Apply checks also
  to flags and photos reused from previous years, but quietly don't
  reuse in that case if format and extension mismatch.

* Add more automation for rotating photos server-side.

* Restrict access to retired photos and flags, similar to the
  restrictions on access to retired person and country records.  (This
  is a corner case, since access is already restricted to the photos
  and flags for retired person and country records, and to the
  non-current photos and flags for all person and country records.)

* Add user interface for removing a language, replacing all requests
  for it by requests for a given other language.

* In the registration system, show more past participation information
  rather than just a link.

* Generate automatic suggestions of possible past participation links
  where same name and same country or staff.

* Support for registration contact to view room allocations for their
  country and people sharing rooms with them.

* Support entering accommodation preferences / requests.

* Support for automatic room allocation based on information about the
  capacities of available rooms and which rooms should have people in
  which roles.

* Support upload of sound files with pronunciation of participant
  names.

* Support other registration information (e.g., passport scan) where
  useful.

* Use database to describe maximum / expected number of people in a
  given role from a country rather than hardcoding.

* Use database to describe other role properties rather than
  hardcoding based on names (also applies to some other things,
  e.g., document generation).  This includes at least contestant
  number, whether should have phone number, which badge background to
  use.  (Need to pass some information through to CSV files so
  registration status generation can work from those.)

* Allow other options for which roles are (initially) expected to have
  phone numbers instead of just participants guiding countries; this
  also affects the explanatory text about missing phone numbers.
  (More complicated if allowed for non-staff participants as well as
  staff.)

* Support for sending emails to registration contacts with reminders
  about missing data, and summaries of present data.

* Add automation for bulk creation of countries in registration system
  from command line (or web interface).

* Support bulk upload of other registration details.

* Support self-registration accounts (that can register a single
  person in a particular role only, for both staff and normal
  countries, so people can enter some of their own data).

* Ensure all tables in the registration system use ``thead`` and
  ``tbody`` to facilitate uses involving sortable tables.

* Support for not publishing scores until the results are final, or
  for hiding some scores until all are entered or until the results
  are final, for events wanting such restrictions.

* Add more registration system sanity checks against mistakes by
  administrative users (open-ended issue).

* Support multiple new people being the same person on the static site
  (e.g., same new person as deputy for multiple countries, such as
  host country main and B teams).

* Move more registration system code out of
  :py:mod:`matholymp.roundupreg` rather than depending on Roundup
  interfaces (facilitates code sharing between multiple registration
  back ends).  At least, most of the logic for scaling down photos and
  maybe most of the caching code.

* Support automatic suggestions of possible medal boundaries, with
  information provided about how close those boundaries are to ideal
  on various metrics.

* Add more automated testing for registration system code.

The following ideas are more speculative.

* Reduce the differences between static site and registration system
  CSV files (generally, include more data in registration system
  files, at least once results complete).

* Add more sanity checks for past participation information (not
  allowing multiple countries pointing to same past country, or
  pointing to past staff countries).

* Support Unicode sorting of names in the registration system in more
  cases.  The main ones are done, but this theoretically applies to
  lists of members of many classes that don't go through matholymp
  code.  Also e.g. "plain" versions of ``other_roles`` and
  ``guide_for`` may not have the desired sorting.

* Add RSS feeds of new registered participants and changes to public
  participant details (old versions of changed data maybe shouldn't be
  public, but could still indicate that something has changed or is
  new).

* Add Python 3 support in registration system code (not very useful
  until Roundup supports Python 3, and may already be ready for Python
  3 apart from that).

* Make registration system code avoid time-of-check / time-of-use race
  conditions (registering multiple people with the same role from the
  same country at the same time; creating / editing countries to
  duplicate country codes at the same time; entering scores for
  multiple problems for the same country at the same time; conceivably
  others).

* Support retiring special countries, as long as this doesn't affect
  the special "anonymous" or "admin" users.

* Support logical role ordering within countries rather than only
  alphabetical.

* Add a public list of country contacts.  Or a private list for future
  hosts, or both with support for different contacts on the two lists.
  Add support for editing contacts that affects future years as well.
  (More generally, add automation for keeping user account passwords
  from year to year.)

* Allow people to enter just time for arrival / departure if on the
  standard dates.

* Support entering ranges for scores during coordination, so that
  medal boundaries can be considered based on such partial
  information.

Document generation
-------------------

* Don't hardcode English as a language to give to all leaders.

* Make draft papers say somewhere which draft version they are.

* Add more thorough testing for :command:`mo-document-generate`
  (background and logo PDFs, flags, photos, inclusion of room / phone
  numbers on badges, actual contents of LaTeX files, escaping of names
  and accented characters in documents).

* Add borders round flags on name badges (and website?).

* Allow labels for contestant desks to show more than two languages.
