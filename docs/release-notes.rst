Release notes
=============

These release notes do not cover changes to the Python API of
matholymp, which is considered unstable.  If making use of matholymp
at the Python API level (such as by writing your own scripts importing
matholymp modules, or making substantial changes to the example HTML
templates for the online registration system that involve calls to
matholymp APIs not in the provided examples), you should examine the
source code changes to determine if any API changes require changes to
your code.
